
Overview
- Here i have trained dataset using **VGG16** Transfer Learning technique of CNN for classification.
- Here i have trained this model till **28 epochs** and i got **69.77%** accuracy.
- Initially i had trained my model with **Inceptionv3** and it's gave me **90.34%** accuracy. But it was not accurate when i tested it on some images. But when i tested **VGG16** with **69.77%** accuracy it gives me accurate result.

About the Dataset
